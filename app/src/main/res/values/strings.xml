    <string name="emom_explanation">
        An acronym for \"every minute on the minute\", EMOMs are HIIT-style workouts, in which you
        alternate between short, intense bursts of exercise with complete rest.
        \n
        \nEMOM workouts challenge you to complete an exercise for a certain number of reps in less
        than 60 seconds. The remaining time within the minute serves as your recovery.
        \n
        \nThey are very versatile - you can focus on cardio or strength, use bodyweight or
        equipment, and are usually anywhere from 4 to 45 minutes long.
